{Break Defenders}

For my Breakout project, i'm planning to create a combination of breakout & space invaders. enemies will spawn from the top of the screen endlessly, and will make their way towards the bottom of the screen. the player needs to bounce the ball to defeat enemies & rack up a high score! if 3 enemies reach the bottom, the game ends, and the high score is saved.

instead of a  joystick, I'm planning to use a simple touch system, where the paddle follows the most recent touch on the screen(at least,the X value of the touch.)
